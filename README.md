# MOFBits

A way to represent MOF structures as binary vectors. 

Written by Eric Taw

## What does this do?

It takes MOFids, as generated by the [mofid package](https://github.com/snurr-group/mofid) and transforms them into fixed-length vectors of bits akin to [fingerprinting molecules](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci100050t). In fact, under the hood, this package makes use of [RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit) and its fingerprinting functions for part of its representations.

## What are bit-vectors and why use them?

Bit vectors are simply vectors of zeros and ones. We use RDKit's implementation of `ExplicitBitVect` as a memory-efficient way to store such vectors. As for why we use them, the cheminformatics literature has long used these to do similarity searches and machine learning. Moreover, a slight modification of common similarity metrics in a supervised machine learning context can provide importance information for certain features, automatically making machine learning models interpretable. 

## Dependencies

- rdkit (note that `pip` will not check for this. Install this from `conda` instead)
- tqdm

## Installation

Clone this repo into a directory of your choice, navigate to it, and do `pip install .`
